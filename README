This directory has C source code for Graphplan.

graphplan.c, utilities.c, and hash.c contain code for interacting
with the user and for building the planning graph.

planner.c contains code for the searching phase of planning.

lex.yy.c and y.tab.c contain code for reading in files in prodigy
syntax.

dummy.c contains stubs for what otherwise would be the X-interface
code.  (Once I get that code semi-portable, that will be here
instead).

Have fun.
